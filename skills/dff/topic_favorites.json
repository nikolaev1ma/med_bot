Its not that the protagonist doesn't have any issues in his life but the way he tackles them with optimistic spirit is really appreciable. I always feel better morally when I watch any of these movies. Moreover it's really fun watching those. Their school activities are really amusing and magical."},
    "book": {"name": "the catcher in the rye", "story": "It's believable. Holden was different and had some flaws so it was a different type of book. His true companion was his sister and she made him to return home. I always wondered about the future of the character. In the novel, you can't predict what happen the next moment and you will keep on reading to find out the solution of the character's problem which isn't even mentioned in the book."},
    "game": {"name": "minecraft", "story": "I enjoy Minecraft for the endless amounts of things you can do. I like a little building, making some small farms or grinders, fishing.

    "show": {"name": "gossip girl", "story": "I started watching Gossip girl a few months ago. And it turned out to be the perfect mix of drama, romance, comedy and everything an amazing series needs.  Most shows are unable to continue with a good story plot in their further seasons but according to me, Gossip Girl accomplished this task too throughout the series. And after all, I can't believe it was Dan - the Gossip Girl!"},

    "series": {"name": "garfield", "story": "We live in a time where we are made to feel guilty for not exercising and oversleeping and overeating, but Garfield is cool with that. He likes it all and he is not apologetic about it. He just lays it out there the way it is. That is what I really appreciate about him because he kind of holds the mirror back to the reader. He throws it back with a humorous twist."},

It suggests that humans remember best in sevens because that is how human brains prefer to store data."},
    "all time favorite movie": {"name": "avengers endgame", "story": "Endgame was everything I hoped it would be. I cheered, laughed, got angry, stressed, irritated, and cried multiple times. I liked that heroes got worthy, if not always happy, endings. Natasha died — but in a way that guaranteed her ledger was back in the black. Tony died — but he died making the sacrifice play that once wasn’t in him to make, fixing the biggest damn problem ever set him. Clint got his family back. Bruce finally got his life and peace of mind back. Thor saved his people — okay, some of them. A few. And after everything he’s done for us, who’s going to begrudge Cap’s getting the happy ending he deserves?"},

Therefore, I loved her with all my heart. Now that I'm at home again, she is always waiting for me in my bed. I stroke her, and she purrs back to me. I am glad that I have a cat, and I am not going to give it up."},
